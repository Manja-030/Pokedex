# Pokedex

My first JavaScript App: A digital encyclopedia of pokémons. It loads data from an external[Pokémon API](https://pokeapi.co/). The app displays a list of Pokémons. If the user clicks on one of the Pokémons, a modal opens and displays an image and some imformation. Its also possible to search for a specific Pokémon by name.
