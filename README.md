USER GOALS
A digital encyclopedia of pokémons. The user can view a list of pokémons. By clicking on a pokémons name the user can see an image of it and get more information such as height, weight, types and abilities.
The user can also search pokémons by name.

and see informationmore details for a given data item on demand.
It’s up to you to come up with a type of data you want to display (see this list of public APIs for an
example); however, if you don’t have any special preferences, you can write a small Pokédex app to
display a list of Pokémon.

User Goals: A digital encyclopedia, which displays the original 151 Pokemon. Within the pokedex, each pokemon should have basic data such as height, weight, types, abilities and their proper images.
